# CGI-Project
Final Code/Explanation Submission for my CGI project

ADAPTIVE PROCEDURAL TERRAIN GENERATION.
Please click this link in your browser. It will take you to a G-drive folder that has the link to the .blend file (CGI Project.blend).
Github does not allow more than 25MB files, and the .blend cannot be compressed. The folder has all files related to the project, alongside this Github repository

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tsaFZM2Ly9k8WcI43TNC_89kwywFJqIE?usp=sharing

Also, pls go through the File titled CGI Project ppt for an explanation of the geometry node setup and test renders

How to run the project:
1. Download the Blender file (CGI Project.blend)
2. Open it in Blender
3. Go to the Geometry Nodes panel from the top of the interface
4. Click on the cube that you see. Go to the modifier tab (blue spanner icon ðŸ”§) on the right-hand side of the screen. Click the TV Icon ðŸ“º, just below the Add Modifier button to display the landscape in the viewport.
5. In the node tree you see, all green nodes can be edited to experiment with how the geo node tree works. They are mostly labelled. The red node in the centre controls the density of each of the scatter systems.
6. The green nodes handle how wide the river is, the falloff of the land, the falloff of vegetation, the density of scatter systems etc.
7. Press fn + 12 to render an image of the scene from camera view.

To change the shape of the river:
1. In the object list on the top right, select NurbsPath.
2. Click Tab to go into edit mode. You will see the vertices of the river.
3. Select any vertex you wish to change.
4. Click G on the keyboard and then do Shift + Z. Your vertex should now follow your touchpad/mouse movements, along the plane.
5. Use your mouse/touchpad to move the point to where you would like.
6. Left click to confirm position.
7. The landscape will adapt to the river's position. Additionally, all vegetation and rocks will adapt according to the new position of the leaves.





Geometry Node Setup Explanation

Terrain
Starting with a square Plane (4 vertices). I first scale and subdivide the mesh and set a material to it. The starting mesh does not really matter, because I am anyway deleting it and replacing it with a plane. I could have even used a sphere or cube for the terrain.

Water
I've taken a NURBS Path, and wrapped an array of planes to it, such that the planes follow the curve and set a material to it. To interact with the terrain, I have converted the curve to mesh. 


Displacement Generation

This can be done using any noise generation node/function. (Perlin/Voronoi etc.). We start the displacement by choosing a noise pattern. This is a 2D noise pattern that I have used to generate 3D height maps using the Combine XYZ node, which allows us to separate the 3 axes and choose which one we want to affect. To generate displacement, we need to use the Z value of the plane. We control the displacement using a curve node. This is a nonlinear adjustment to the height values from the noise texture. The noise is a gradient of black and white. I've used it such that the white regions mean elevation and black means depressions - but this can be inverted at any time by multiplying by -1.
One the curve, 
Lower distances are lifted slightly.
Midrange is more steeply boosted.
Higher values are closer to linear.
What I've done next is to take the original position of that point and then vector add it to the new value from the curve. This pushes point on the terrain up and down and generates displacement.


Land and River Intersection - Geometry Proximity.

Geometry Proximity and distance node calculate points on the terrain from the river (NURBS Path). This is connected to a XYZ node, which allows us to affect each of the axes separately. For this, we want the Z value to be affected, So that points on terrain that are close to the river, their Z values (displacement values) are lowered, below river level. 

How much to lower the Z value is done by the multiply add node - which decides from where to start lowering the Z values. This basically controls how wide the river should be and the falloff of the land.
If Distance = 0.0  â†’ Output = 0.04 (closer to river edge - these points will be have the lowest Z value)
If Distance = 1.0  â†’ Output = 0.77 (0.73 * 1 + 0.04) (farther away from river - no change in Z value.
But Clamping is on, so any values outside the 0â€“1 range will be clipped.
This gives a falloff from the river outward, between 0.04 and 0.77 ( for this setting of the Multiply node.)


Scattering Systems

I have used 2 scattering systems. 
One is a global scattering, that scatters the chosen model over the entire landscape - but is gradually removed closer to the river.
The points(grass models) that are scattered are controlled by the geometry proximity setup above. 
Scattering using geo nodes is done by marking points all over the geometry - this is what the density value of the node does(how many points do you want over that geometry). And each point is instanced to a model/object or a collection of objects that we can choose. So now I am rending the points as plant meshes. 
Output = (Distance Value Ã— Multiplier) + Addend. [Distance value is dist of point from river.] 
Fade out or softly control the density of Grass 1 and Grass 2 near the river.
The way they are scattered is through a Perlin noise and a Voronoi noise texture. I've done this to make the distribution a more random. I've applied random rotation according to the normal of the surface. Scale is also randomized between a set range.

The second is a system that scatters rocks and leaves close to the water. The scattering method is the same, but the border control is inverted. That's why I have multiplied the the distance value by -1. This inverts the scattering and now, experimenting with the multiplier and add nodes, I can get more rocks and leaves close to/in the river. 
Random Value Node
Outputs a random float per instance between 0.3 and 4.0.
Multiply Node
Multiplies R by -1.0.

So now:
M=R Ã— âˆ’1.0
This just inverts the random value, flipping the range from (0.3 â†’ 4.0) to (-4.0 â†’ -0.3).
The add node randomly subtracts a value between the range from some other scalar input, but clamps it to prevent the value from going below 0.

Why use this entire geo node system?

Normally, to make a terrain like this, first you would have to make the landscape and add all the displacement. And to add the waterbody, you would have to line up the water manually to get the correct height and width. Then add different scatter systems for different vegetation types. And if you would need to make a change to the river for example, you would have to edit the mesh of the landscape again and vice versa.

This geo node approach is procedural & non-destructive. -You can adjust rivers, paths, vegetation zones, etc., in real-time without redoing the terrain.
In a few clicks you have a full terrain with you - one can keep adding scatter systems, more waterbodies. This is very helpful for creating biomes(forest, mountains, arctic).
All the user has to do is have their models/obj files downloaded so that they can drop it into the tree.
You can make custom drivers and keep adding to the node tree and testing new variations in real time.
This geo node setup can be used across multiple projects.
